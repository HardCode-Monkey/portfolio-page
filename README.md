# Portfolio Page
This repository contains my portfolio page for the EWEB (Web Engineering) course at the Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH). This project will be graded and be overseen by Syrian Hadad.

# Disclaimer

I used AI for generating the styling. But all choices and deciion of font, color and even the grid was my choice. The API which is in the source i from the offical code from spotify itself. The conent of the page and it structure is also from my creation.

# Deadline and Deliverables

The submission deadline is **December 19, 2025**.

The following items must be submitted:
1. A link to this repository.
2. A link to the public GitHub Pages site.

# Grading Criteria (max. 50 Points)

| Criteria | Description | Points |
|:---| :--- |:---|
| 1. Accessibility | The site must be publicly accessible via GitHub Pages. Without a working URL, no evaluation will be given. | Knock-out criterion |
| | | |
| 2. Responsiveness | How well does the page adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)? | 15 Points |
| | 0 Points: Works only in a single screen resolution. Content is cut off or unreadable. | |
| | 5 Points: Works in common desktop and laptop resolutions (1024px–1920px). Text, images, and layout adapt correctly. | |
| | 10 Points: Partially works on mobile devices (<768px), but minor issues (e.g., scrollbars, overlaps) exist. | |
| | 15 Points: Fully responsive. No cut-off content, no scrollbars. Scaling and media queries are used meaningfully. | |
| | | |
| 3. Code Quality and Complexity | How structured and technically sophisticated is the code? Frameworks are evaluated neutrally and offer no advantage over pure HTML/CSS/JS. | 20 Points |
| | 0 Points: Unstructured code. Inline styling or no separation between HTML, CSS, and JS. | |
| | 5 Points: Basic separation of HTML, CSS, and JS. CSS classes have partially descriptive names. Simple code without dynamic content. | |
| | 10 Points: Cleanly structured code with modern technology (e.g., CSS Grid, Flexbox). First dynamic content (e.g., simple DOM manipulations). | |
| | 15 Points: Modular and maintainable code: •Dynamic content: API calls, data binding, form validation. •Third-party controls: Integration of libraries like Chart.js or Leaflet.js. | |
| | 20 Points: Sophisticated technical implementation: •Complex API integrations: Data combination, authentication. •Efficient data processing: Caching, pagination. •Complex third-party integrations: e.g., D3.js for diagrams. | |
| | | |
| 4. Commit History | Does the commit history document the project's progress in a traceable and meaningful way? | 10 Points |
| | 0 Points: All commits were made on a single day. No progress documentation. | |
| | 5 Points: Commits are distributed over at least half of the project duration. Progress is visible, but with generic messages (e.g., "Update"). | |
| | 10 Points: Evenly distributed over the entire project duration. Commit messages are concise and describe the changes meaningfully. | |
| | | |
| 5. Design and Functionality | Is the site visually appealing and functionally well-implemented? | 15 Points |
| | 0 Points: No clear structure or design line. Content is confusing, important functions are missing or faulty. | |
| | 5 Points: Basic design (color scheme, typography) and navigation are present. Minor weaknesses in layout or user guidance. | |
| | 10 Points: Consistent design, clear visual hierarchy, and intuitive navigation. Important elements (e.g., buttons) are highlighted meaningfully. | |
| | 15 Points: Professional and user-friendly design. All functions are meaningfully integrated and visually appealing. | |
